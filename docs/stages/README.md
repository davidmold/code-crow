# code-crow Development Stages

This document outlines the staged development approach for code-crow, breaking the project into manageable phases that build upon each other.

## Stage Overview

### Stage 1: Foundation Setup
- Create basic monorepo structure
- Set up package.json files and TypeScript configuration
- Basic boilerplate for all packages
- **Goal**: Get the project structure in place and buildable

### Stage 2: Local Claude Code Integration
- Implement basic Claude Code SDK integration in the agent
- Create simple CLI interface for the agent
- Test local Claude Code execution
- **Goal**: Prove we can programmatically control Claude Code

### Stage 3: Basic Web Interface
- Create Vue3 frontend with basic UI
- Implement Express server with REST API
- Connect frontend to backend (no Claude Code yet)
- **Goal**: Get the web interface foundation working

### Stage 4: WebSocket Communication
- Add WebSocket support to server and agent
- Implement real-time communication protocol
- Connect all three components (web ↔ server ↔ agent)
- **Goal**: Enable real-time communication between components

### Stage 5: Core Features
- Implement project browsing in the web interface
- Add Claude Code execution through the full stack
- Real-time streaming of Claude Code responses
- **Goal**: MVP that's actually useful for development

### Stage 6: Enhanced UX
- Add session management and history
- Improve error handling and user feedback
- Polish the interface and add conveniences
- **Goal**: Make it significantly better than the CLI

### Stage 7: Production Ready
- Add proper logging and monitoring
- Improve error handling and edge cases
- Performance optimization
- **Goal**: Stable, reliable system ready for daily use

## Next Steps

Start with Stage 1 to get the foundation in place. Each stage should be fully working before moving to the next one.

See the individual stage documents for detailed implementation instructions.
