# Stage 6: Enhanced User Experience

## Goal
Polish the interface and add conveniences that make code-crow significantly better than using Claude Code CLI directly. Focus on usability, productivity features, and quality of life improvements.

## Prerequisites
- Stage 5 completed (core features working end-to-end)
- Basic functionality proven and stable

## Tasks

### 1. Advanced Chat Interface
Enhance the chat experience:
- **Syntax highlighting** for code in messages
- **Multi-line input** with proper text editor (Monaco Editor)
- **Command templates** for common development tasks
- **Auto-completion** for file paths and common commands
- **Message formatting** with markdown support
- **Copy/paste code blocks** with proper formatting

### 2. Session History & Management
Implement comprehensive session management:
- **Persistent history** stored locally and/or on server
- **Session search** to find previous commands and responses
- **Session export** to share or document workflows
- **Session templates** for repeated development patterns
- **Favorite commands** for quick access
- **Session branching** to try different approaches

### 3. Project Management Features
Add project-specific conveniences:
- **Project favorites** and quick switching
- **Project-specific settings** (allowed tools, system prompts)
- **Recent projects** list
- **Project search** across file contents
- **Git integration** (show branch, status, etc.)
- **Project templates** for new development workflows

### 4. File Management Integration
Enhance file operations:
- **Diff viewer** for file changes made by Claude Code
- **File change notifications** with undo capabilities  
- **Bulk file operations** (select multiple files for context)
- **File preview** with syntax highlighting
- **File search** within projects
- **Quick file access** (recently modified, favorites)

### 5. Visual Improvements
Polish the interface:
- **Dark/light theme** toggle
- **Responsive design** for tablets and mobile
- **Progress indicators** for long-running operations
- **Status bar** with connection info, current project, etc.
- **Keyboard shortcuts** for common actions
- **Loading states** and skeleton screens

### 6. Developer Experience Features
Add power user capabilities:
- **Command macros** (save complex multi-step workflows)
- **Variable substitution** in commands (${projectName}, ${currentFile})
- **Conditional execution** based on project type or file presence
- **Parallel execution** of independent commands
- **Command scheduling** and automation
- **Integration hooks** for external tools

### 7. Error Recovery & Debugging
Improve error handling:
- **Detailed error messages** with suggested fixes
- **Command retry** with modified parameters
- **Rollback capabilities** for failed operations
- **Debug mode** with verbose logging
- **Connection diagnostics** and troubleshooting
- **Performance monitoring** and optimization suggestions

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Interface feels polished and professional
- [ ] Common development tasks are faster than CLI
- [ ] Session management makes complex workflows manageable  
- [ ] File operations are intuitive and safe
- [ ] Error recovery is smooth and helpful
- [ ] Power users have advanced capabilities available
- [ ] New users can be productive quickly
- [ ] Performance is fast and responsive

## Key Features to Implement

### Command Templates
```typescript
interface CommandTemplate {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  command: string;
  variables: Variable[];
  category: 'development' | 'debugging' | 'refactoring' | 'documentation';
}

// Example templates:
// "Add unit tests for ${fileName}"
// "Refactor ${functionName} to use async/await"
// "Add TypeScript types to ${fileName}"
```

### Session Export
```typescript
interface SessionExport {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  timestamp: Date;
  project: ProjectInfo;
  commands: CommandHistory[];
  results: string;
  metadata: {
    duration: number;
    filesModified: string[];
    linesChanged: number;
  };
}
```

### Macro System
```typescript
interface Macro {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  steps: MacroStep[];
  conditions?: Condition[];
}

interface MacroStep {
  type: 'command' | 'wait' | 'confirm';
  data: string;
  timeout?: number;
}
```

## User Experience Improvements

### Keyboard Shortcuts
- `Ctrl+Enter` - Execute command
- `Ctrl+K` - Focus command input
- `Ctrl+Shift+P` - Command palette
- `Ctrl+H` - Toggle history panel
- `Ctrl+\` - Toggle file explorer

### Smart Defaults
- Auto-detect project type and suggest relevant commands
- Remember user preferences per project
- Intelligent working directory selection
- Context-aware command suggestions

### Productivity Features
- Quick access toolbar for common operations
- Drag-and-drop files into chat for context
- Batch operations on selected files
- Integration with external editors (VS Code, etc.)

## Claude Code Command
```
Enhance the user experience with advanced chat features, session management, project tools, and visual polish. Add Monaco editor, diff viewer, command templates, session history, and keyboard shortcuts. Focus on making it significantly more productive than the CLI.
```

## Next Stage
Once the UX is polished and feature-complete, move to Stage 7 to make it production-ready with proper logging, monitoring, and deployment preparation.
