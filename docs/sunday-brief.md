  Cleanup Opportunities:
  - Remove debug console.log statements throughout
  - Standardize error handling patterns
  - Consolidate duplicate code blocks
  - Improve type safety with stricter typing
  - Clean up the remaining TypeScript warnings in server/web packages
  - Refactor some of the more complex methods into smaller, focused functions

  Tomorrow's Strategy ðŸ“‹

  1. Test the core flow (messaging, session continuation, project switching)
  2. If it works: Focus on cleanup and polish
  3. If issues remain: Debug and fix, then cleanup
